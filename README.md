**Intents** is a unofficial Python library to define and operate Dialogflow Agents with a simple,
code-first approach.

## Project status

This project is still in early development stage, its API could change without
notice. This is a broad overview of the features that are planned and their
completion status.

| Feature           | Status | Note                                                                                |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Agent Definition](STATUS.md#agent-definition)  | ðŸŸ¢     | Can define basic Intents, with examples, parameters and responses                   |
| [Cloud Sync](STATUS.md#cloud-sync)        | ðŸŸ¡     | Can export Agent to a valid Dialogflow ZIP. Cannot yet manage Google Cloud Projects |
| [Prediction client](STATUS.md#prediction-client) | ðŸŸ¡     | Can act as a client for predictions and triggers. Cannot receive webhook requests         |

A more detailed view of the single features is reported in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)

## Install

*Intents* can be installed as follows:

```sh
pip install intents
```

## Usage

Intents are defined like standard Python **dataclasses**:

```python
@dataclass
class HelloIntent(Intent):
    """A little docstring for my Intent class"""
    user_name: Sys.Person = "Guido"
```

Their **language** resources are stored in separate YAML files:

```yaml
utterances:
  - Hi! My name is $user_name{Guido}
  - Hello there, I'm $user_name{Mario}

responses:
  default:
    text:
      - Hi $user_name
      - Hello $user_name
      - Nice to meet you, $user_name
```

Agents can be automatically **exported** into Cloud Dialogflow projects; *Intents* will act transparently as a prediction client:

```python
df = DialogflowEsConnector('/path/to/service-account.json', MyAgent)
predicted = df.predict("Hi there, my name is Mario")  # HelloIntent(user_name="Mario")
print(predicted.fulfillment_text)                     # "Hello Mario"
```

For a complete working example, check out the included [Example Agent](example_agent/). Also, *Intents* **documentation** is published at https://intents.readthedocs.io/ ðŸ“š
